The main goal is to implement a new computerised system of hardware inventory. This system is used by ICT department of Melchester College, exploiting facilities provided by the "ict_hardware_inventory" database. The service can be accessed using both MySQL Workbench GUI interface together with Xampp, which is using MySQL as a server for the database or it can be accessed through Xampp and the interface is going to be PhpMyAdmin. 25 This method of accessing data in the inventory can be obtained easier and faster than the old system used, where the inventory data were handwritten into an inventory register. Knowing that the implementation of such systems is very beneficial in all aspects, a systematic approach to this issue is required and involves the construction of new database hardware inventory system. Long term benefits are expected by using this approach. The ICT manager is thinking that the new computerised system will serve the following specifications: • offer quick access to hardware and supplier details • provide maintenance history on individual items of hardware • provide records of hardware allocated to subject areas • offer inventory details of hardware in each room • deal with government returns on the number of PCs allocated to Admin v Curriculum The system is a combination of elements (components) interconnected between them, establishing a dynamic interaction based on predetermined rules to achieve a common goal.
